# Designer to Unity Transition

Some resources to help a non-3D designer get on the tools and productive.

Getting down to the construction site project is _likely_ enough to get you by on project work, but techniques picked up in subsequent sections will be _quite_ valuable as well.

## Unity Learn

### Roll-a-Ball - 2h
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Anyone using Unity should be able to make this game, coder, designer, or neither

https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball

Welcome to Roll-a-ball! In this learning project, you’ll:  
* Use Unity Editor and its built-in capabilities to set up a simple game environment
* Write your own custom scripts to create the game functionality
* Create a basic user interface to improve the game experience
* Build your game, so other people can play it!

### Intermediate Design: Unity Game Development Course - 8h
⭐⭐⭐⭐ Simple but important game dev in Unity.

https://learn.unity.com/course/intermediate-design-unity-game-development-course

These intermediate courses will teach you about prototyping game systems, iterative level design, and designing modular sets. 

### Design, Develop, and Deploy for VR - 23h
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Top notch, very comprehensive

https://learn.unity.com/course/oculus-vr/?tab=overview

In this comprehensive course from Oculus and Unity, you’ll learn how to build an immersive VR game step by step. Designed for people who have an intermediate knowledge of Unity, the goal of this course is to teach you how to design, develop, and deploy a VR application. You’ll learn an extensive range of principles and best practices: from locomotion and hand presence, to optimization and testing, to user interaction and go-to-market strategy.

Coached along the way by experts from Oculus and Unity, you'll build a vertical slice of an escape room game throughout the course. While the course is geared towards developing for the Oculus Rift, the principles covered also apply to the Oculus Quest, and you’ll learn to avoid some common pitfalls we see developers experience when submitting their application to the Oculus Store. Take your VR skills to the next level with this deep dive into the principles of VR development.

### VR Development: Build a Full Construction Site Tour - 18h
⭐⭐⭐⭐ Practical, would get pretty good demo-ware afterwards

https://learn.unity.com/course/build-a-full-construction-site-tour/?tab=overview

Turn concept into reality with this  course on virtual reality (VR) for construction visualization and  planning! This course equips you with a  robust toolkit of skills for the Unity 3D engine. Learn how to build  and use virtual reality during the pre-construction planning phase to  evaluate logistics and safety hazards, familiarize work crews with the  site, and communicate design and engineering decisions with clients and  stakeholders.

### Design Eye-catching UI in Unity - 3h
⭐⭐⭐⭐ get good at UI. Foundational concepts that can move from project to project

https://learn.unity.com/project/design-eye-catching-ui-in-unity

User Interfaces are the glue between the player and the game that often go overlooked. In this project, Design Eye-catching UI in Unity, you will learn how to create an immersive UI that will take your game to the next level. 

First, you will learn the basics of designing your digital aesthetics. 

Next, you will explore how to put together UI components that every game needs, including life bars, dialogue systems, and maps. 

Finally, you will discover how to customize these components to fit your game theme and give your players that extra wow factor. By the end of the project, you’ll have a foundational understanding of the UI components that turn good games into great games.

### Advanced Design: Unity Game Development Course - 6h
⭐⭐⭐ More advanced game dev. Might be too niche

https://learn.unity.com/course/advanced-design-unity-game-development-course

These advanced courses will teach you more about cinematic design and post-processing and polish. 

### MR Functionality - 3h
⭐⭐⭐⭐ A little outdated, but this is a key area of focus for us

https://learn.unity.com/project/mr-functionality?courseId=5d32bcc6edbc2a0021d72146

In this project you will learn about:
	• MR Interaction
	• Interactive UI Menus
	• Sequencing Animations with the Animation Manager

### Unity's Game Prototyping Series - 6h20m
⭐⭐⭐⭐ Some parts are less relevant (e.g. Cinemachine), but some are very important (rigging, shader graph, particle systems)

https://learn.unity.com/course/unity-s-game-prototyping-series

Welcome to Unity's Prototype series! This series, created by the Unity Evangelism team, will showcase the creation of playable prototypes, showing how multiple features of Unity can be used to achieve game mechanics that can be used in real-world scenarios. Each month a new episode of the series will be released. Each episode includes a video explaining how the mechanics were created, the project assets, as well as supporting tutorials to learn more about the features used in each prototyping series.  

### Buried Memories: High Fidelity Game Visuals - 9h
⭐⭐⭐ - It's tangentially related, but the techniques picked up here are immensely valuable for our work. Get that foundation up.

https://learn.unity.com/course/buried-memories-high-fidelity-game-visuals

* Learn about high visual fidelity, and tools to deliver this using Unity
* Explore three key artistic roles for visual design: Character Artist, Environment Artist and Lighting Artist 
* Understand the approach taken by each artist to deliver high fidelity game visuals for the Buried Memories: Serekh Asset Pack demo
* Apply your learning through creative challenges in a streamlined Unity Project

### VR Beginner: The Escape Room - 3h
⭐⭐⭐⭐ Apply all that knowledge to make a VR game

https://learn.unity.com/project/vr-beginner-the-escape-room

In this project, you will:
* Review basic navigation with your VR controller
* Explore a basic VR prototyping environment
* Add teleporters, interactable objects and sound effects to the prototyping environment using the XR Interaction Toolkit
* Review how to set up Unity to add UI elements in VR
* Explore and evaluate the Escape Room, a fully realised VR experience


### Introduction to XR: VR, AR, and MR Foundations - 11h
⭐⭐ Looks primitive, but has some use around designing / assessing AR apps in there

https://learn.unity.com/course/introduction-to-xr-vr-ar-and-mr-foundations

Throughout the course, we’ll give a brief description of each of the supporting technologies, some history about when it first came into use, limitations and future potential for improvement, and how it’s used for AR, VR, and MR. As you learn about the technology, you’ll also develop hands on experience in the field along two tracks. First, you will use Unity to build and run two simple XR applications on your own smartphone: a “VR Museum” app and a handheld Augmented Reality app. Second, you will brainstorm, define, visualize, and iterate your own original concept for an XR application, ending the course with a thorough and peer-reviewed XR Product Brief that you could use as the basis for future development. This is the first of three planned courses in Unity's XR Specialization, which include the Mobile VR App Development with Unity course as well as a future course focused on developing Augmented Reality (AR) applications with Unity.
