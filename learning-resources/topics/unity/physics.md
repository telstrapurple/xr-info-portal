# Physics

[&olt; back](../../README.md)

Use rigid bodies and colliders to create a physics playground

## Scene overview

-   A bunch of balls rolling around and interacting with physics

## Prerequisites

-   MonoBehaviour and game object basics
-   UI Events might be useful

## Knowledge Gained

-   Prefabs

## Expected time to complete

-   Beginner: 3 days
-   Expert: 4 hours

## Simple guide

1.  Create a small environment (a few planes to act as a floor and walls)
2.  Add a ball with a rigid body on it and watching it fall
3.  Experiment with physics materials to make it behave as you want
4.  Add a capsule and write a small "player controller" script, that basically moves it with WASD
5.  Make this capsule a kinematic rigid body. How does it interact with the ball? What if it wasn't kinematic?
6.  Make the ball change colour whenever it collides
7.  Add some more balls. How does this react?
8.  Add LOOOTS more balls.  Feelin the framerate?
9.  Remove balls to get back to a reasonable framerate Add a bunch of cubes all around the place, with no rigid body, but with a collider
10. Add a little script or animation to those cubes to make them move around a little bit
11. Hit play and look at the profiler.  Bad?
12. Add rigid bodies to those cubes
13. Hit play and look at the profiler.  Better or worse? Why?
