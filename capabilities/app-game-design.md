Implementation of playable prototypes and UX / UI / designs. Tuning for aesthetics and feel.

_Note: This is NOT related to what's usually called game design (balancing, level design, mechanics etc.) which is covered more broadly by concept design / project management in anenterprise environment.  This role is on the tools, prototyping and implementation oriented._

Especially important for prototyping.
