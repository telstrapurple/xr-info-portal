# App / Game Design

[&olt; back](../README.md)

Design <progress value="0.7"></progress> Dev

Implementation of playable prototypes and UX / UI / designs. Tuning for aesthetics and feel.

_Note: This is NOT related to what's usually called game design (balancing, level design, mechanics etc.) which is covered more broadly by concept design / project management in anenterprise environment.  This role is on the tools, prototyping and implementation oriented._

## Topics

* Prototyping
* User experience
* 2D and 3D user interfaces
* Events and dispatch
* Broad knowledge across all tooling

## Tools

More than any other role, app/game design requires broad knowledge of tooling across the spectrum - game engine, image editing, 3d modelling, sound etc.  

Especially important for prototyping.

## Self-Assesmsent

- [x] I can quickly create prototypes to test out game or feature concepts
- [x] I can create UI elements for user interaction, and wire them up to application logic
- [x] I can trigger animations, material changes, etc. for responsiveness and feel
- [x] I can integrate any textures/sounds/models required for the application
- [x] I can produce simple placeholder textures/sounds/graphics if necessary
- [x] I can guide an artist/sound engineer to create assets required for my design implementation
