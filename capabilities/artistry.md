### Blender Guru's tutorials

This guy's [channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/AndrewPPrice/playlists) is full of goodies.  Start with the donus tutorial

[Donut Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPrnSACiTJ4&list=PLjEaoINr3zgEq0u2MzVgAaHEBt--xLB6U)

Really good first tutorial on how to model something (admittedly pretty basic) - learn the ropes 

[Intermediate Modelling Tutorial - Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjEaoINr3zgHJVJF3T3CFUAZ6z11jKg6a)

This series gets more real - learn about best practices, and more in depth things like topology, in-depth materials, texturing / UV mapping.  

Note: This tutorial is for blender 2.79, so best to be familiar with the 2.80 UI before diving in to this one.
